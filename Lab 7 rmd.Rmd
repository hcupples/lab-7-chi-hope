```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This: I am Hope and I am updating this markdown file here.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv('gc_df.csv')

```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?

```{r}
get_guns <- gc_df %>%  
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>%  
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n)

get_guns

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")

```
